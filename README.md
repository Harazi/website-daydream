Increase the usefulness of your docked or charging Android with Website Daydream.

This daydream allows you to display any website in full-screen on your Android 4.2+ device. You can scroll and interact with the web page or (if you prefer) disable touch for a traditional screensaver-like experience.

Here’s some things you could do with it:

- Have your favourite news website on display
- Display your personal / company website
- Create your own interactive daydreams with HTML5 canvas
- Show what’s ‘now playing’ on your home media centre.
